Angry Birds is a funny puzzle game, released in 2009, which had a great success due to its colorful and fun interface and free basic use of
the program. The plot of the game is simple, it is about a group of birds that are angry with pigs which have stolen the bird's eggs. The game will allow players to throw the birds against pigs with the goal of hitting them. Players will have to face up to different scenarios. In every scenario only 3 different types of birds can be used. Each type of bird has different abilities which are activated after the player tap on the screen while the bird flies. For each level there is a fixed number of birds that can be launched by a sling/catapult with a defined order. The goal of the game is hitting every pig present in the scenario, in which pigs cover under shelters made of different types of materials like wood, stone and glass. A level is completed if every pig is hit and the score of each level is obtained by considering the number of buildings destroyed and birds not used.
The Angry Birds AI Competition was created to deal with the problem of finding an agent which is able to play Angry Birds. The task include a lot of problems to be solved like analyzing the scenario and come up with a good strategy to use in order to reach a high score. Various subtasks need to be considered to achieve this goal. For example, a computer vision component which is able to describe what is in the scenario including the materials and shape of the walls of the shelters.

Our project is based on the work of the competition participants in 201?, the AngryHEX agent \cite{}. Their approach was to create an agent which models the knowledge of the game by means of an Answer Set Programming knowledge base.
Our goal is to improve their approach by trading higher order predicates that are used in the ASP system with more complex objects in order to speed up the computation and bho.
