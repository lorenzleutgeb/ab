\section{Complex Predicates~vs.~Complex Objects}
\label{sec:main}

In this section we present how a specific class occurences of higher order predicates can be translated to first order by introducing more complex terms.

For example, consider the following rule taken from the tactics of \ah:

$$ canPush(o_a,o_b) :- \&canPush[objects,hills](o_a,o_b). $$

Intuitively, $canPush(o_a, o_b)$ should be true if the object $o_a$ can push the object $o_b$, which requires some minimum distance and geometric range.

Note that $objects$ and $hills$ are predicates, and in turn $\&canPush$ is a higher order predicate. We observe that $objects$ and $hills$ characterize the set of objects present in the current level of the game and the structure of the ground in the game respectively.
